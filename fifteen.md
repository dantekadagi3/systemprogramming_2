Certainly! Let's break down the code line by line.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```
This line includes the standard input/output library in the program, which is necessary for using functions like `printf` and `fgets`.

```c
int main() {
```
This line defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. Execution of the program starts from this function.

```c
    char str[100];
```
Here, we declare a character array named `str` that can hold up to 100 characters. This array will be used to store the line of text entered by the user.

```c
    printf("Enter a line of text: ");
```
This line uses the `printf` function to print the message "Enter a line of text: " to the console, prompting the user to enter some text.

```c
    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);
```
This line reads a line of text from the standard input (stdin) and stores it in the `str` array. The `fgets` function takes three arguments:
- The array where the input will be stored (`str`).
- The maximum number of characters to read (`sizeof(str)`), which ensures we don't read more characters than the array can hold.
- The input stream to read from (`stdin`), which is the standard input (usually the keyboard).

```c
    printf("You entered: %s", str);
```
This line prints the message "You entered: " followed by the content of the `str` array. The `%s` format specifier is used to print a string.

```c
    return 0;
```
This line returns 0 from the `main` function, indicating that the program executed successfully.

```c
}
```
This closing brace marks the end of the `main` function.

In summary, this program prompts the user to enter a line of text, reads that input, and then prints the input back to the user.
